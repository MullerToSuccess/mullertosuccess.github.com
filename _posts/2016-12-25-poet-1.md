		No man is an island
		entire of itself
		every man is a piece of the continent
		a part of the rain
		If a clod be washed away by the sea
		Europe is less
		as well as if a promontory were
		as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own there
		any man's death diminishes me
		because i am involved in mankind
		and 
		therefore
		never send to know for whom the bells tolls
		it tolls for thee
